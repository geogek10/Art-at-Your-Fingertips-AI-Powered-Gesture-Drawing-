Using the capabilities of Mediapipe (a library that provides tools for you to apply AI and machine learning tecgniques, made by Google) and some other libraries such as OpenCV and Numpy, we created a drawing enivronment. 
This is not just a simple drawing environment. We use AI models that recognise your hands. By doing some specific signs you can choose a characteristic from our friendly user interface and then by doing another sign you
can start drawing! This environment has some other capabilities such as saving your drawing in your laptop and auto-emailing it to your e-mail account.

What our project provides
-------------------------

Investigations show that kids appeal to things relevant with technology, the most. So, drawing with your hands using only a screen is more fascinating for them. Our environment also saves parent's (on this example -with kids)
money from buying the necessary equipment for drawing. It can also be useful for people that face learning struggles.

This technique can be applied not only for drawing, but also in other fields such as industry and medicine. For instance, you can use such techniques that an AI recognises the doctor's hand who is carrying out an
operation from distance.
